# Arcane Network
A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Server Network

This repo includes all of my old code for my collection of Minecraft servers that I operated until 2018. <br/>

I built the servers with the PocketMine-MP API using PHP. <br/>
PocketMine-MP is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server software written in PHP. <br/>
For more information on PocketMine-MP and its API, check out <a href="pmmp.io">https://pmmp.io</a>
