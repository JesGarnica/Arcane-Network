# Arcane Network
A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Server Network

This repo includes all of my old custom plugins/addons for my collection of Minecraft servers that I operated until 2018. <br/>
The plugins add in features that includes network-wide economy, player ranks, a faction system, and a simple mini game engine that powers games such as Capture the Flag. <br/>

I built the plugins with the PocketMine-MP API using PHP. <br/>
PocketMine-MP is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server software written in PHP. <br/>
